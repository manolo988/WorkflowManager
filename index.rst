Welcome to Workflow Manager
================================
The design of our framework defines three main management units: Workflow management, which takes application information from the user, identify dependencies,
and control the execution of the workflow. Autonomic management, which acts as the “brain” of our architecture by storing and analysing all data collected from 
applications and resources, which is used to take operational decisions adapting allocated resources to meet user’s objectives.Federation management, which uses 
software-defined techniques to create an elastic and dynamic federation of resources that can shape itself based on user’s constraints or resources availability.
